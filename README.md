🕵️‍♂️ Wireshark Network Traffic Analysis

📌 Overview

This repository contains the screenshots, captured packet files, and analysis reports from a network traffic monitoring task using Wireshark.
The purpose of this project is to capture, filter, and analyze live network packets to understand different protocols and their communication flow.


---

🛠 Tools Used

Wireshark – Network protocol analyzer

Active Network Interface – For live packet capture

Linux / Windows – Operating system used for analysis



---

📋 Steps Performed

1. Installed Wireshark on the system.


2. Selected the active network interface for live packet capture.


3. Generated traffic by browsing websites, pinging servers, and other online activity.


4. Captured packets for a specific duration and stopped the capture.


5. Applied protocol filters such as HTTP, DNS, and TCP to view targeted packets.


6. Identified key protocols and analyzed communication patterns.


7. Exported the .pcap file and saved screenshots of filtered packet views.

📊 Analysis Summary

HTTP – Observed request & response communication between client and server.

DNS – Recorded queries and responses for domain name lookups.

TCP – Verified reliable connection setup using the three-way handshake.
