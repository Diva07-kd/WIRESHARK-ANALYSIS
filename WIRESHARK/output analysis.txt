OUTPUT ANALYSIS (From Screenshots):

    Screenshot 1 & 2: HTTP Traffic (tcp.port == 80)

    Captured packets with filter: tcp.port == 80 (HTTP).

    Observing unencrypted HTTP communication between client and server over port 80.

Observations:

    Frame 76 is a SYN packet → start of TCP connection.

    Followed by SYN-ACK and ACK → completing the 3-way handshake.

    Then HTTP packets are exchanged (GET/POST).

    Data and ACKs are visible in clear text.

What it shows:

    This is a successful HTTP connection.

    You can inspect:

        Headers

        Payload

    Full request/response (since it's unencrypted)

Conclusion: HTTP traffic is fully visible in Wireshark. You can analyze every request
and its response, which is useful for debugging web issues or learning HTTP.


Screenshot 3: HTTPS Traffic (tcp.port == 443)

    Captured packets using tcp.port == 443 (HTTPS).

    You're observing encrypted web traffic over TLS (HTTPS).

Observations:

    Initial TCP 3-way handshake is visible.

    Then a TLS handshake begins:

        Client Hello

        Server Hello

        Key exchange and cipher negotiation

    After the handshake, everything is encrypted

What it shows:

    You can only analyze:

        Handshake steps

        Encryption protocols used

        Certificates exchanged (if available)

    But you can’t read the actual data like HTTP.

Conclusion: HTTPS traffic is encrypted, and you can’t see the content (like login info or pages).
But you can still analyze the TLS session quality, performance, and issues.
